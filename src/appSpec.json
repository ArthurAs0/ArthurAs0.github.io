        "designSummary": "This brand design embraces a modern, minimalistic aesthetic characterized by a fresh and airy color palette dominated by pastel greens and deep charcoal tones. The layout is modular and spacious, featuring rounded corners and generous padding that create a soft, approachable interface. Typography is clean and geometric, likely using a sans-serif font such as 'rubik-v2' or 'work-sans-v2', supporting clarity and readability. The navigation bar is distinct with a pill-shaped background in a light pastel green, enhancing usability and visual separation. Interactive elements like buttons and icons are minimal and subtle, with the bright lime green 'brandAccent' color used sparingly to draw attention to calls-to-action such as the WhatsApp icon. Overall, the design conveys a professional, trustworthy, and innovative brand personality, suitable for technology or home product industries focused on quality and user experience.",

The 'secondary' color serves as a background for content blocks or secondary UI areas, with 'secondaryForeground' used for text and icons in these areas to maintain readability. The 'contentBlockBackground' custom color is ideal for subtle section backgrounds that need to stand out gently against the main background without overwhelming the design. Use 'buttonOutline' for secondary or outlined buttons to maintain brand consistency. The 'iconColor' is suited for icons and minor graphic elements, providing a muted contrast that complements the overall palette. This palette ensures accessibility and visual hierarchy while maintaining a modern, tech-savvy aesthetic.",

The 'contentBlockBackground' against 'background' offers a gentle contrast suitable for non-textual UI elements and backgrounds.

The layout employs modular grids with generous negative space, balancing text and iconography in a harmonious, user-friendly manner. Buttons are solid, rounded rectangles with dark backgrounds and white text, emphasizing clear calls to action.

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'background' color as the primary canvas for all pages to maintain a clean and calm atmosphere. The 'primary' color should be reserved for main text, headings, and key interactive elements such as buttons and links, paired with 'primaryForeground' for text on these elements to ensure readability. The 'secondary' color and its 'secondaryForeground' are ideal for subtle UI accents, secondary buttons, and category tags, providing gentle contrast without overpowering the primary content. Custom colors like 'softYellowAccent' and 'lightPurpleAccent' are best used sparingly for highlighting informational badges, icons, or subtle background gradients to add visual interest while preserving the minimalist tone. This palette ensures accessibility and visual harmony, supporting a professional and approachable brand presence.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primary' color (#1E254E) on 'background' (#F7F9FF) achieves excellent contrast exceeding WCAG AA standards for both normal and large text. Buttons using 'primary' with 'primaryForeground' (#FFFFFF) also meet AAA contrast requirements. The 'secondary' color (#A59FE6) on 'background' provides sufficient contrast for UI accents and secondary text, meeting WCAG AA for large text. Custom colors 'softYellowAccent' and 'lightPurpleAccent' are used in small UI elements and backgrounds where contrast requirements are less stringent but should be paired with 'primary' or 'primaryForeground' text to maintain readability and accessibility compliance."
